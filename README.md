# Serial Debug and IMU Drivers for STM32


This is still a work in progress.

The repository contains the following drivers;

 +) Serial Debugging: This driver is somewhat compatible with the "Serial" module.

 +) IMU Driver: Currently only has support for the MPU-6050 sensor and only uses I2C. Future updates will add more sensors and SPI.
